# The base style to inherit from (LLVM is the standard for C/C++)
BasedOnStyle: LLVM

# Use 4 spaces for indentation (Common for modern C)
IndentWidth: 4

# Ensures the brace stays on the same line as the control statement (if/while/for)
BreakBeforeBraces: Attach

# Align parameters on the next line if they don't fit on one line
AlignAfterOpenBracket: Align

# Set the maximum line length to 100 characters to keep code readable
ColumnLimit: 100

# Put the pointer alignment to the right (int *ptr instead of int* ptr)
# This is the standard convention in C to avoid confusion in multi-declarations
PointerAlignment: Right

# Ensures there is a space after control flow keywords (if, for, while)
SpaceBeforeParens: ControlStatements

# Adds a space after the '//' in a comment for better readability
SpacesInContainerLiterals: true

# If a function call's arguments are too long, put them on new lines
AllowAllParametersOfDeclarationOnNextLine: false

# Keeps 'else' on the same line as the closing '}' of the 'if'
AllowShortIfStatementsOnASingleLine: false

# Disallows putting an entire function on a single line
AllowShortFunctionsOnASingleLine: None

# Sort #include directives alphabetically (keeps headers organized)
SortIncludes: true

# Adds a space after a cast: (int) x -> (int)x
SpaceAfterCStyleCast: false

# Ensures that the indentation of 'public/private' (if used in C++ headers) 
# or labels (like 'goto:' labels) is handled correctly
AccessModifierOffset: -4

# Indent 'case' labels inside a switch statement
IndentCaseLabels: true
